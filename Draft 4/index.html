        <h1>What do Ugandans like on Facebook?</h1>
        <p>Facebook remains the most popular social media website in Uganda. As of June 30th 2016, there are approximately <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/">2,200,000</a> Ugandans on Facebook, of whom <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-Facebook-users-are-there-in-Uganda">1,500,000</a> are active users (at least check-in once a day). From a digital marketing perspective, the question then becomes what are all these Ugandans on facebook interested in? Essentially, what do they like? <br><br>To answer this question, I gathered data on the top 50 Ugandan pages, by number of likes, and then categorised each page by what type of page it is e.g. Music, Newspaper, Radio, Politics etc ... The result was the colorful interactive chart below.</p>

          <h4>Ugandan's Like Telecom Companies</h4>
          <p>Ugandans' love for Telecom companies like MTN Uganda, Airtel Uganda, Africell Uganda and Vodafone Uganda is indicative of the love they have for communicating with their phones. Mention the abbreviation "MBs" and most Ugandan Netizens will know exactly what you are talking about. #DataisLife</p>

          <h4>Ugandan's Like Television, Newspapers and Radio</h4>
          <p>The need to be informed is likely what makes Ugandan's like Television station, Newspaper and Radio station pages on Facebook so much. Being illinformed means not knwoing what other people are gossiping about, or even what hot topics to start gossiping about yourself. Hence pages such as NTV Uganda, NBS Television, WBS Televsion , Stratight Talk Africa, New Vision, Daily Monitor, Galaxy FM, Capital FM etc etc ... rank high in this top 50 list.</p>

          <h4>Ugandan's Like Music</h4>
          <p>Its no secret that Ugandans love Music. Local Musicians on Facebook have a loyal following and hence appear high on this list of the top 50 most liked pages. Artists like Julianna Kanyomozi, REMA, Bobi Wine, Bebe Cool, Eddie Kenzo, Irene Ntale and Jose Chameleone top the Music category with over 200, 000 local fans, a piece. However, its important to note that some artists like Eddie Kenzo, REMA, and Julianna also have huge fanbases outside Uganda.</p>
